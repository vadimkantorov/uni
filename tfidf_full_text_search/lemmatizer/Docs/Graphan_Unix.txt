This is a program of graphematical analysis (Russian, German, and English languages).

This program is distributed under the Library GNU Public Licence, which is in the file
COPYING.  

This program was  written by  Alexey Sokirko.  

The system has been developed under Windows 2000 (MS VS 6.0), but
has also been compiled and run under Linux(GCC).  It should work with
minor changes on other systems.
